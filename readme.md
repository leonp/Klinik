## Installation

Place the theme files and folders in a folder. Copy this folder to your `/wp-content/themes` folder and choose the Klinik theme from the admin area's `Appearance &#rarr; themes` menu.

## Fonts

The theme uses a `ff-pro, georgia, serif` font stack. If your website visitors don't have FF Pro installed on their machines they'll see Georgia.

If you want to use your own font stack you'll need to use a plugin or create a child theme.
