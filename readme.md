## About

Klinik is a WordPress theme. I use it at http://leonpaternoster.com

## Installation

Place the theme files and folders in a folder. Copy this folder to your `/wp-content/themes` folder and choose the Klinik theme from the admin area's `Appearance &rarr; themes` menu.

## Fonts

The theme uses a `ff-more-web-pro, georgia, serif` font stack. If your website visitors don't have FF More Pro installed on their machines they'll see Georgia.

If you want to use your own font stack you'll need to use a plugin or create a child theme.

## Images

Klinik refers to 2 images in the `/images` folder:

1. `portrait.jpg`: The first link in the navigation list. Should be a square picture. The theme resizes automatically.
2. `favicon.jpg`

Replace the pictures of me with some of yourself (or anything else, for that matter).
