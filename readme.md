# Readme

## About

Klinik is a one column, mobile first, responsive WordPress theme.

## Installation

Download or clone this repo. Copy the theme folder to your `/wp-content/themes` folder and choose the Klinik theme from the admin area's `Appearance > themes` menu.

## Images

Klinik refers to 2 images in the `/images` folder:

1. `portrait.jpg`: The header logo. Should be a square picture. The theme resizes the image automatically.
2. `favicon.jpg`

You can change the logo via the `Appearance > Header` menu. Replace the favicon image with your own small jpg.

You can add a `bleed` class to images to make them bleed into the left margin at 960px+

## Custom archives page

Klink comes with an `archives-custom.php` template. It lists all categories and then all posts. To use it create a new page and select *Archive listing template* from the Template dropdown menu.
