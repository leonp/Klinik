## About

Klinik is a WordPress theme. I use it at http://leonpaternoster.com

## Installation

Place the theme files and folders in a folder. Copy this folder to your `/wp-content/themes` folder and choose the Klinik theme from the admin area's `Appearance &rarr; themes` menu.

## Fonts

The theme uses a `georgia, serif` font stack and `'Nimbus Sans L', 'Helvetica Neue', arial, sans-serif` for headings and secondary text.

If you want to use your own font stack you'll need to use a plugin or create a child theme.

## Images

Klinik refers to 2 images in the `/images` folder:

1. `portrait.jpg`: The first link in the navigation list. Should be a square picture. The theme resizes automatically.
2. `favicon.jpg`

Replace the pictures of me with some of yourself (or anything else, for that matter).
