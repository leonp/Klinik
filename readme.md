## About

Klinik is a WordPress theme. There's also a changelog.

## Installation

Download or clone this repo. Copy the theme folder to your `/wp-content/themes` folder and choose the Klinik theme from the admin area's `Appearance > themes` menu.

## Images

Klinik refers to 2 images in the `/images` folder:

1. `portrait.jpg`: The first link in the navigation list. Should be a square picture. The theme resizes automatically.
2. `favicon.jpg`

Replace the pictures of me with some of yourself (or anything else, for that matter).

You can add a `bleed` class to images to make them bleed into the left margin at 960px+
