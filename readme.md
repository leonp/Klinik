## About

Klinik is a one column, mobile first, responsive WordPress theme.

## Installation

Download or clone this repo. Copy the theme folder to your `/wp-content/themes` folder and choose the Klinik theme from the admin area's `Appearance > themes` menu.

## Images

Klinik refers to an image in the `/images` folder:

`portrait.jpg` is the header logo. Should be a square picture. The theme resizes the image automatically.

You can change the logo via the `Appearance > Header` menu. Replace the favicon image with your own small jpg.

## Custom archives page

Klink comes with an `archives-custom.php` template. It lists all categories and then all posts. To use it create a new page and select *Archive listing template* from the Template dropdown menu.
